## Abstract from the paper

This article looks at the labor force participation in Australia over the last 35 years, a period in which it has experienced considerable dynamism. An empirical equation is first derived from a macroeconomic model for the labor supply. Using real data from several sources, I find relatively large estimates of the labor supply for the short and long elasticities with respect to unemployment and the working age population. In particular, the short (long) run elasticity to unemployment is estimated to be around 0.16 (0.52). For the working age population, I report elasticities similar in magnitude---about 0.17 and 0.53, respectively. I then explore heterogeneity across employment in different economic activities. Such exercise yields an long run elasticity for wages that is in line with prior research (around -0.10). Results are robust to the role of considered confounders.
